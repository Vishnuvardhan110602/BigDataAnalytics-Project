🚗 BMW Sales Data Analytics (2010–2024) using Apache Spark & Machine Learning
📊 Project Overview

This project presents an end-to-end Big Data Analytics and Machine Learning pipeline analyzing BMW’s global sales data (2010–2024).
It leverages Apache Spark (PySpark) for large-scale distributed processing and Spark MLlib for predictive modeling to extract key business insights, market trends, and sales forecasts.

The analysis uncovers BMW’s evolving sales trends, fuel-type transitions, and model performance while applying ML algorithms for forecasting and segmentation.

🧭 Objectives

Analyze BMW’s sales trends over time (2010–2024).

Examine the impact of region, fuel type, transmission, and pricing on sales.

Predict future sales for 2025–2027 using machine learning models.

Identify influential factors affecting sales performance.

Cluster BMW models based on pricing, performance, and sales volume.

🧩 Dataset Description

The dataset includes BMW car model details from 2010 to 2024 with the following features:

Model – Car model name

Year – Year of release/sales

Region – Geographic region of sales

Fuel_Type – Petrol, Diesel, Hybrid, or Electric

Transmission – Manual or Automatic

Engine_Size_L – Engine capacity in liters

Price_USD – Model price in USD

Sales_Volume – Number of units sold

🧠 Machine Learning Implementations
1️⃣ Linear Regression – Sales Forecasting

Forecasts BMW’s total sales for 2025–2027.

Identifies long-term sales growth trend.

2️⃣ Random Forest Regression – Feature Importance

Predicts Sales_Volume based on multiple attributes.

Ranks key influencers such as Price, Year, and Engine Size.

3️⃣ K-Means Clustering – Model Segmentation

Groups BMW models into Economy, Mid-Range, and Luxury segments.

Helps visualize market segmentation and target demographics.

📈 Key Insights

BMW’s global sales grew steadily from 2010–2024 with notable peaks around 2017 & 2021.

Transition toward electric and hybrid models has accelerated since 2018.

Automatic transmissions dominate with increasing adoption rates.

Asia emerged as the highest-growth region in sales volume.

Correlation between Price and Sales Volume is moderately negative, indicating stronger demand for mid-range models.
